"""Provider runway adapters (DESIGN §11).

One adapter per provider, each returning the same ``Runway`` record. Four
read a remote endpoint, two read CLI-owned local state.

Key handling (W-0182): a key comes from OPENCODE'S OWN CREDENTIAL STORE,
``~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json``, falling back to a named environment
variable. It is read inside the adapter, used for one request, and never
returned, stored, printed, or logged. ``raw`` is assembled from named fields
and then scrubbed, so no response body (which may echo a key) reaches the
database or the screen. ``api_key`` returns the value and a SOURCE LABEL;
only the label is ever safe to show.

Failure model: every adapter fails soft. Unreachable, unauthorized, garbage
JSON, or a local file whose shape drifted all yield a ``Runway`` with
``remaining=None`` and a ``reason``. Adapters never raise (DESIGN §11:
unknown runway means the provider is available and marked unknown; dispatch
never blocks on a failed scraper).

Windows, not providers, are the unit of a reading (W-0179): a provider is
ONE record carrying EVERY window it reports, because a 5-hour limit and a
weekly limit are two facts about one plan. There is no ``limit`` on a
window (W-0182) — every window is a percentage of itself, so a limit is
always 100 and says nothing.

Staleness survives only where it changes meaning (W-0182): a reading whose
window has already reset is history, and says so. The age of a reading is
kept on the record for the conductor, which must not trigger on old numbers,
and is no longer narrated to the reader.

Two provider KINDS (W-0179). A ``plan`` provider (Claude, Codex, Kimi,
MiniMax, Grok) is a subscription: it shows consumption against its windows
and never a price. Only an ``api`` provider (DeepSeek, anything billed per
token) shows money — DeepSeek's account balance is the point of its card.

A plan may still bank something spendable, though (W-0184): Codex and Grok
both hold usage RESETS, which are not money and belong on a plan's card. Any
adapter can put a finished phrase in ``raw["credits"]`` and every surface
renders it in the one block DeepSeek's balance already used.
