"""The conductor (DESIGN §10): a goal, watched by code, judged episodically.

A **goal** is a Work task tagged ``goal`` and ticked ``delegated`` (§1, the
epic pattern). The sweeper keeps claiming ordinary delegated items; this
module watches goals and nothing else.

- **The conductor is deterministic code.** It reads the board, maps runs to
  the goal and its children, decides whether an event worth judging has
  happened, assembles the packet, applies the decision and logs it. **Zero
  tokens while anything is merely in flight** — a run that is simply running
  produces no trigger, so no session is ever started for it.
- **A planner turn is episodic judgment.** On a trigger, one fresh stateless
  session gets one code-curated packet and returns one structured decision.
  The decision is logged and attributed; the session is discarded. Cost
  scales with events, not elapsed time.

**Triggers** (five, priority order): a new human comment on the goal, a run
blocked, a batch settled, provider runway low, nothing in flight. Each one
carries a *key* — the batch it settled, the run that blocked, the comment's
timestamp — and fires exactly once for that key, because a turn is recorded
with it. That is what keeps "nothing in flight" from waking a planner
forever on an idle goal: its key is the last settled run, so it fires once
per settle and then never again until something settles. The three quiet
triggers (blocked, settled, nothing-in-flight) describe one moment from
three angles, so the first of them to take its turn silences the other two
for that batch: one settle is one turn.

A **floor** of ``TURN_FLOOR_SECONDS`` per goal sits in front of all five. A
turn returning ``wait`` names the event it waits for, and until that event
arrives no other trigger wakes the goal.

**Nothing approves itself.** A planner judging a worker's proposal
(``findings.PLANNER``) is a fresh session that is never the worker's, and
``alignment_planner`` refuses outright if the proposing run turns out to be
a planner turn of this goal. A planner's own next step is ``dispatch``, not
a proposal.

``conductor_turns`` is Orchestra's own log and the conductor's whole memory:
the floor, the wait gate, the once-per-settle guard and the delta watermark
are all queries against it. Only state-changing turns also post to the
goal's Work thread; a ``wait`` turn lives only here.
