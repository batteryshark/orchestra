"""Delegation allowlist and spawn bounds, enforced at the broker (DESIGN D11).

A profile's ``spawn_profiles`` names exactly which profiles it may delegate
to; absent or empty means it may not delegate at all. Orchestra's spawn is
brokered — a worker writes a request, the supervisor decides — so the
enforcement point is this code, never the model's judgment.

The allowlist is intersected with the PROJECT'S ENABLED SET (W-0187):
delegation is the second moment a project's choice of profiles binds, since
a child run is a run being staffed. The parent is not re-checked — it keeps
the preset it launched with.

``spawn_profiles`` answers *who*; ``max_spawn_depth`` and
``max_children_per_run`` answer *how many* (DESIGN §5). Those two bounds
matter because dispatch has no concurrency cap of any kind (§4): the spawn
tree is the only path by which run count grows without a human ticking
something, so it is the one thing that has to be bounded.

ponytail: a spawned child run is identified by ``requested_by = 'spawn'``,
which is what keeps continuations (which also set ``parent_run``) out of
both counts. The child-launch seam below must set it; nothing else may.

    ``cfg`` must therefore be the project's config (``config.load(
