"""The staffing turn (W-0183): which profile runs a swept item.

Every swept item used to be staffed with the single ``[work] profile``, so a
trivial item and a hard one got the same model. Work cannot fix that: CONTRACT
§6 keeps backends, models and harnesses out of Work entirely, and a tag like
``profile:opus-high`` would leak exactly what the contract forbids. The
decision therefore belongs HERE.

On claim, one bounded turn on a CHEAP profile — ``[work] router`` — reads the
item and names the profile to staff, out of the profiles the project ENABLES
(W-0187), using the ``tier``/``priority`` metadata that exists for exactly
this (W-0181: 1 workhorse / 2 generalist / 3 heavy, priority ordering within a
tier). Same trade the spin observer makes: one cheap call, so the expensive
one is only paid when the item needs it.

**Routing must never block a dispatch.** No ``[work] router``, one profile
enabled, a router profile the project disabled, a dead process, a reply that
is not JSON, a name outside the enabled set — every one of them returns the
``[work] profile`` unchanged, with the reason it fell back. Nothing here
invents the judgement, which is ``conductor.parse_decision``'s posture:
anything that is not exactly a valid answer is a NON-answer.

The enabled set is enforced twice on purpose — ``parse_choice`` will not read
a name that is not in it, and the name it does read is still resolved through
``config.staff_profile``, the one gate a staffing moment goes through.

# A claim waits on this turn, so it is deliberately shorter than the spin
# observer's 180s: the item is already `in_progress` on the board while it

INSTRUCTIONS = """\
You are Orchestra's staffing router. You have ONE job: pick which model profile \
runs the work item below.

You are not doing the work and you are not planning it. Read the item, judge \
how much model it actually needs, and name the CHEAPEST profile that can \
genuinely do it. Over-staffing a trivial item wastes the expensive model that \
a hard item will need later; under-staffing a hard one wastes the whole run.

How to read the list:
- tier 1 (workhorse) = well-defined, bounded work with the answer in sight.
- tier 2 (generalist) = ordinary work that needs judgement.
- tier 3 (heavy) = the hardest thinking: ambiguous, cross-cutting, or design.
- priority orders profiles WITHIN a tier — LOWER is more preferred.
- role and note are the owner's own words about what a profile is for.
- runway is that provider's measured headroom. A profile with almost none \
left is a bad choice even when its tier fits.

You may ONLY name a profile from the list. Any other name is refused and the \
project's default is staffed instead.

Reply with ONE JSON object and nothing else:
{"profile": "<exact name from the list>", "reason": "<one line: what about \
this item needs that profile>"}
