"""Who is calling: the human, or one specific run (DESIGN §3, §5).

Two credentials reach the HTTP surface, and they are not the same authority.

- **The shared secret** — ``X-Orchestra-Key`` from the 0600 config, the
  dashboard's and the iOS app's credential. Full authority, unchanged.
- **A per-run token** (W-0176) — minted at dispatch into the worker's
  environment as ``ORCHESTRA_RUN_TOKEN`` and sent as the *same* header. It says
  which run is calling, it cannot claim to be the human, it cannot act on a
  sibling run, and it stops working the moment its run ends.

Before this the split was a DECLARATION: an ``X-Orchestra-Run`` header the
caller chose, or ``ORCHESTRA_RUN_ID`` in its own environment. Every worker
holds the shared secret, so a worker that simply omitted the header was
treated as the human — auditable, never contained. A token inverts that:
omitting it does not promote you, it only fails.

Storage is the hash, never the value: ``runs.run_token_hash`` holds the
SHA-256, the raw token exists in the worker's environment and nowhere else.
Revocation is a database trigger (``db.SCHEMA``), so every path to a terminal
status revokes without a finalizer having to remember.

``ROUTES`` below is the entire authority table. It lives here, in one dict,
so the answer to "what may a run do" is read rather than reconstructed from
handlers — and an unlisted route is the human's by default, so adding a route
never accidentally hands a run authority.
