"""Single owner of Dromond's SQLite schema (clean v1 — a greenfield has no
legacy, so there are no migrations; future subsystems join THIS schema and
bump meta.schema_version when they extend it).

Data-model invariants (DESIGN D4):
- ``runs.id`` is the only address for a run. ``runs.slug`` is a memorable
  display alias (UNIQUE so concurrent dispatchers cannot double-mint one).
- ``runs.profile`` records which launch template started the run — pure
  provenance/display. Nothing keys on it.
- ``messages`` address run ids. There is deliberately no recipient-name
  column: a profile is a launch template, never a worker identity.
  ``undeliverable_at``/``undeliverable_reason`` (schema v9, DESIGN §6) mark a
  message whose run ended before it was delivered. Marked and surfaced, never
  dropped — and never moved to a later run, which would hand a correction to
  a run that never saw the context it referred to.
- ``runs.work_item`` (schema v2, the sweeper) is the durable mapping to the
  Work item (``W-####`` task or ``issue_*``) that a run serves;
  ``work_seen_ts`` is the ferry watermark for that item's thread, and
  ``work_reported_at`` marks that the completion writeback happened.
- ``runs.project_id`` (schema v4, the daemon) is Work's immutable
  ``projectId``. Rows key on it, never on a path: one central database now
  holds every project's runs, and renaming a folder must lose nothing.
  ``runs.workdir`` stays a path because it is where a process actually ran.
- ``dispatch_queue`` (schema v8, DESIGN §4) holds Work items that cannot
  start yet, with the reason. It is queue state only: nothing dispatches
  from a row here, and the run row appears at actual dispatch.
- ``runway_polls`` (schema v5, DESIGN §11) is a self-contained append-only
  log of provider runway polls — one row per adapter per poll, unknowns
  included. It references nothing and nothing references it. ``windows``
  (v12, W-0179) is every window that poll reported; the scalar columns are
  the tightest live one, which is what dispatch and the trend read.
- ``events`` (schema v6, DESIGN §7) is the ONE normalized trace table: every
  backend's JSONL is mapped into the same seven kinds at ingest. The raw
  file stays the source of truth — each row carries a truncated payload
  plus the byte offset/length of the line it came from, so a viewer expands
  in place. ``trace_cursors`` is the per-run tail watermark (and the record
  that a terminal run's raw log was pruned).
- ``finding_fingerprints`` (schema v9, DESIGN §9) is the dedup ledger for
  filed findings: one row per ``(project, where, normalized claim)``, so a
  repeat increments ``occurrences`` and comments on ``issue_id`` instead of
  filing a duplicate Work issue. Owned by ``findings.py``.
- ``observations`` (schema v9, DESIGN §7) is the spin observer's record: one
  row per judgement, from any of its three layers, with the reasoning that
  produced it. It exists because the observer may never silently kill a run
  — a stop has to leave its reasoning somewhere durable — and because the
  hourly cadence anchors on the last row for a run. ``runs.retry_of`` (also
  v9) is the retry lineage: which run this one is the single automatic
  retry of, so a second consecutive infrastructure failure is countable.
- ``runs.tokens_*``/``cost_usd``/``usage_source`` (schema v9, DESIGN §11) are
  the backend's own usage totals, stamped on the row at completion so
  statistics are a query and never a re-parse. All NULL when the backend
  reported nothing recognizable — ``usage_source`` names the parser that
  produced the numbers, and NULL there means "not captured", never "zero".
- ``conductor_turns`` (schema v10, DESIGN §10) is the conductor's log AND its
  only state: one row per planner turn, carrying the trigger and the key that
  makes that trigger fire exactly once. Owned by ``conductor.py``; references
  Work item ids rather than run ids, because a planner turn is not a run.
- ``runs.run_token_hash`` (schema v11, DESIGN §3/§5, W-0176) is the SHA-256 of
  the per-run token minted at dispatch into the worker's environment. Only the
  hash is ever stored — the raw token lives in the worker's environment and
  nowhere else, the same discipline the config applies to provider keys.
  Revocation is the ``revoke_run_token`` trigger below rather than a call
  every finalizer has to remember: reaching a terminal status nulls the hash,
  whichever code path got the run there. Owned by ``auth.py``.
- ``runs.layer`` (schema v15, W-0214) marks a CONTROL TURN — a router,
  merge-judge, observer or conductor model call — recorded as a terminal
  runs row so its transcript normalizes into ``events`` and opens in the
  same detail screen as a run. NULL is a worker run. Fleet queries exclude
  turns with ``layer IS NULL``; queries keyed on work_item, branch or
  parent_run never match one, because a turn carries none of them.
- ``nod_requests`` (schema v7, the human loop) maps a Nod request id to the
  run and Work item it escalated, so a decision can be mirrored into the
  Work thread. ``channel`` is stored because a Nod issuer token is scoped to
  exactly one channel: a later decision/wait/cancel read has to pick the
  credential for the channel the card was filed to, never guess.
  ``acted_at`` (schema v14) marks that the daemon's answers pass acted on
  the card's decision — stamped exactly once, so an answered card never
  retriggers on the next tick. Owned by ``nod.py``; carries no issuer token.
