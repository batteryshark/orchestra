"""Nod client: file escalations, collect decisions (DESIGN §8, W-0168).

Nod (github.com/batteryshark/nod) is the push/input device for Orchestra's
human loop. Orchestra builds no push plumbing of its own; it POSTs a request
card and reads the decision back.

Issuer API used here, all joined onto ``base_url`` (which may itself sit
under a proxy path prefix, e.g. ``https://host/boop``):
- ``POST /api/v1/requests``                 file a card
- ``GET  /api/v1/requests/{id}/decision``   read the current decision view
- ``GET  /api/v1/requests/{id}/wait``       long-poll (1-60s, ``timed_out``)
- ``POST /api/v1/requests/{id}/cancel``     withdraw a pending card

ONE TOKEN PER CHANNEL. A Nod issuer token is scoped to exactly one channel,
so Orchestra holds two: the decisions channel needs an answer, the alerts
channel is dismiss-only, so alerts can be muted without muting decisions.
A ``NodClient`` therefore *is* a channel — it carries that channel's id and
that channel's token, and cannot be pointed at another channel. Routing a
decision-kind escalation at the alerts client (or the reverse) raises
``NodChannelError`` at the call site rather than presenting the wrong
credential and getting a puzzling 401.

Reads that address an existing request by id take the client from the
channel recorded next to that request id in ``nod_requests`` — never a
guess, never a try-both loop.

Token handling: tokens come from ``ORCHESTRA_NOD_DECISIONS_TOKEN`` /
``ORCHESTRA_NOD_ALERTS_TOKEN``, else the 0600 secrets file. They go in the
Authorization header and nowhere else — never a log line, never an
exception message, never the database.

Wiring: ``messaging.py`` files and awaits blocked-run asks, ``merge.py``
files merge-escalation cards, and ``daemon.tick()`` runs ``act_on_answers``
so a tapped merge card actually does something. ``orchestra nod
test|show|cancel`` is the manual surface.
