"""ACP transport: NDJSON JSON-RPC 2.0 over one persistent process (DESIGN §6).

The SECOND transport. Exec stays the default and is untouched: a profile
opts in with ``transport = "acp"``, and only Reasonix and OpenCode may —
they are the two backends that speak ACP (verified live, both report
``loadSession: true``).

What ACP buys over exec, and why this module exists:

* **live ``tell``** — Reasonix's vendor ``_reasonix.io/session/steer``
  injects a message mid-turn, so a correction lands while the worker is
  still working instead of waiting for a safe boundary. No other backend
  can do this. OpenCode has no steer, so its messages go as the next
  ``session/prompt`` on the SAME live session — still no kill, still no
  re-exec.
* **graceful ``session/cancel``** instead of kill-and-resume, which also
  preserves Reasonix's prefix cache: the session id never changes, so the
  next prompt continues where the cancelled turn stopped.
* **``session/request_permission``** arrives as a protocol message that
  Orchestra can answer, rather than a TTY prompt nobody is watching.

**The raw log stays the source of truth** (DESIGN §7). Every frame in both
directions is appended to the run's own JSONL as one line, tagged ``_dir``
/ ``_ts`` / ``_method``, and the backend's stderr goes into the same file.
So ``traces.ingest`` (byte offsets, expand-in-place, retention),
``runners.parse_log`` (session ref, last text) and ``runners.parse_failure``
all work on an ACP run with no changes — the normalized events table is fed
through exactly the same path an exec run uses.

**Failure posture**: a dead peer or a failed handshake fails the run with a
reason. There is deliberately no mid-run fallback to exec — a run whose
transport changed halfway is a run nobody can reason about afterwards.
