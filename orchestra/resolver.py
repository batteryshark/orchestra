"""Act on a merge-escalation card's two verbs (DESIGN §9).

The card a failed landing files offers retry, dispatch a resolver, and leave
it. The answer loop in ``nod.py`` calls in here for the first two, from a
context where an exception helps nobody: ``retry_landing`` always returns a
one-line outcome, and ``dispatch_resolver`` returns the new run id or None
with the reason on stderr.

The retry is ``merge.at_completion`` again — the SAME pipeline an automatic
landing takes (dirty-base guard, ignored-path dropping, tripwire judge,
checks, compare-and-swap), the same Work report, and a fresh card if it
escalates again.

The resolver dispatch is a synchronous ``sweeper._claim``-shaped launch:
insert the run row, ``supervise.prepare_launch``, spawn the supervisor. The
deferred path ('pending' rows the daemon releases) exists for dependency-gated
dispatches, and a resolver has none — its parent is already terminal.

Land the work on `{branch}` onto `{base}`.

Run {run_id} finished, but its branch did not land:
{reason}

Facts:
- The branch `{branch}` is kept, exactly as the run left it. Nothing landed
  on `{base}` and nothing was reverted.
- Your working directory is a fresh worktree of the current `{base}`; the
  failed branch is not checked out here.

Definition of done — the branch's WORK lands on `{base}`:
- Rebase and reconcile `{branch}` against the current `{base}`. Keep both
  sides' intent; neither side's work is the one to lose.
- Run the repository's checks.
- Land it with `orchestra merge {branch}`, or commit the reconciled result on a
  fresh branch and land that with `orchestra merge <fresh-branch>`.

Do not force-push. Do not delete `{branch}` or its kept ref. If you land a
fresh branch, the original `{branch}` stays untouched.

Never commit, stage, or stash uncommitted work in `{base}`'s checkout. It is
the owner's, it is in flight, and a failed pop loses it. If a merge is blocked
by their edits, stop and say which files — that is theirs to clear, not yours.
