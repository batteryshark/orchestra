"""Completion handoff: findings and proposals (DESIGN §9).

Two sibling **required** fields in a run's final message, ``findings: []``
and ``proposals: []``: empty is a valid answer, absent is not. **Code files
them** (principle 6) — the worker never writes to Work, so it cannot forget,
cannot self-approve, and cannot file itself work.

- A finding (``claim`` / ``where`` / ``confidence`` / ``why_not_fixed``)
  becomes a Work issue attributed to the run and never delegated, so it
  lands in triage. Work's issue create has no ``delegated`` field at all:
  not-delegated is the server-side default and the flag is human-only, so
  the invariant is held by not sending anything.
- A repeat of the same ``(project, where, normalized claim)`` fingerprint
  increments an occurrence count and comments on the original issue instead
  of filing a duplicate.
- A proposal is contract verb 5: a task parented to the run's delegated goal
  item, never top-level, attributed to the run. Work gates agent task
  creation on that parent; a rejection is recorded, never retried blind.
- Alignment is a **planner turn, not code** (``PLANNER``, W-0099). Until a
  planner exists every proposal is unevaluated, and an unevaluated proposal
  goes to the human — nothing here approves anything. The mechanical
  tripwires below force human review regardless of any verdict.
