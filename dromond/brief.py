- Keep file changes inside the working directory.
- Commit your git changes before you stop.
- Operator messages may arrive between actions; apply them, then continue the mission.
- Your final message is the handoff: what changed, how you verified it, what remains.
- End it with a ```json block: {"findings": [], "proposals": []} — both keys required, [] is fine. "halt": "reason" stops the run until a human moves the item to ready.
