"""The intervention loop (CONTRACT §4): Dromond's front door to Work.

Deterministic code only (DESIGN principle 6) — one pass:

- **Report**: a finished run posts an attributed comment and transitions its
  item (success → review/resolved; anything else → blocked/needs_human).
  Never done/closed — the human closes (CONTRACT §3 verb 2).
- **Claim**: an item a human marked ``delegated`` (CONTRACT §2; a legacy
  ``agents`` list is history and never counts as delegation) that sits
  in ``ready`` (task) / ``queued`` (issue) with no live run gets one: a
  fresh dispatch, or a session continuation when a prior run for the item
  left a resumable session (the "answer from the phone, the run picks it
  up" path of §4 step 5).
- **Ferry**: a new human comment on an in-flight item is delivered to the
  owning run as a safe-boundary interrupt (the phase-1 delivery path).
- **Cursor**: ``updatedSince`` watermarks live in the meta table and only
  advance after a fully successful pass.
