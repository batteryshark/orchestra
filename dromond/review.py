"""Performance review of runners (W-0130): how each profile actually did.

``dromond stats`` answers "how much did we run"; this answers "how well did
each profile do" — outcomes, not volume — so staffing decisions (tier,
priority, ``dromond profiles note``, all of which the router reads) can come
from evidence instead of impression. Read-only over the runs table: a run
row is stamped at finalization (status, usage), and this never writes.

    A live run is not a review subject, so it is excluded. Neither is a
    control turn (W-0214): a router turn is not the profile's work. Success is
    ``done / terminal runs``; tokens and cost are sums of what was captured,
    with ``uncaptured`` counting the runs that carry no usage (DESIGN §11 —
    null is "not captured", never a zero). A plan-backed run has no price
