"""Managed profile edits: the write path into ``config.toml`` (DESIGN §5).

Profiles are managed, not hand-edited — the dashboard and ``orchestra
profiles`` add, edit and remove them. Three things make that harder than a
dict write:

- **The file is the record, not the database.** The daemon reads config, so
  an edit that landed in SQLite would be invisible to the next run.
- **The file is hand-written and full of comments.** The stdlib has a TOML
  reader and no writer, so this module does *targeted textual surgery*: it
  rewrites only the key lines it was asked to change, inside only the
  ``[profiles.NAME]`` table it was asked to touch. Every other byte —
  comments, blank lines, key order, quoting — survives untouched, and the
  result is re-parsed and diffed against the intended change before it is
  written. A surgery that cannot be verified is refused, never guessed.
- **Write authority is split by cost** (DESIGN §5). An agent may retune a
  note or an effort *downwards*, and nothing else. Adding a provider/model
  entry commits spend — and so does raising an effort, W-0176, or moving the
  tier/priority a planner routes on, W-0181 — so an agent asking for any of
  those gets an ESCALATION filed for the human and *no* config write. The
  split is enforced here, at the one function both the HTTP route
  and the CLI call; *who is asking* is answered by ``auth`` from the
  credential, never from a header or an environment variable the caller
  chose.

  The escalation is one row in ``nod_requests``, the escalation record
  (DESIGN §8), written before anything can fail and carrying the requested
  VALUES. Editing config must not know a record system exists (CONTRACT §7
  Enforcement), so this module records and stops; a source adapter reads the
  record and files the decision the human answers, and `orchestra profiles`
  prints it meanwhile. It is the shape 44c8335 established — the core writes
  the durable thing, the adapter does the source-facing half — with the
  ordering the 2026-08-28 loss made non-negotiable.

Discovery feeds the model/effort pickers (``profiles.discover``); this
module re-checks the picked values server-side, because a picker is a
convenience and a validation is a guarantee.
