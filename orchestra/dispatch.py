"""Dispatch policy (DESIGN §4): order, honest queue state, the pause switch.

There are no concurrency caps here: not global, per project, or per profile.
Concurrent mutation is safe only when each run has an isolated worktree;
shared-checkout runs can interfere. Merges are sequential and rebase before
landing. The operator controls admission with the pause switch and can see the
live run count.

Three things live here, and the HTTP surface (§3, W-0100) imports the same
functions rather than reimplementing them:

- **The pause switch** — ``paused`` / ``pause`` / ``resume`` / ``state``.
  Persisted in ``meta``, so a daemon restart does not silently resume.
  Pausing stops new runs *starting*; runs already in flight are never
  touched, signalled, or counted against anything.
- **The waiting queue** (``dispatch_queue``) — an item that cannot start yet
  is recorded with the reason it waits. It stays out of ``in_progress``: an
  item transitions there only at actual dispatch, because a board that
  claims something is running while it waits stops being trusted.
- **Order**, which matters only for items that must wait: dependencies first
  (a hard constraint), then ready-lane board order exactly as Work returned
  it — Work has no priority field by design, so the board's order *is* the
  priority signal — then FIFO by how long the item has waited.
