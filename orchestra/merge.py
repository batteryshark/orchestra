"""Land a run branch on the base branch (DESIGN §9, "Landing the work").

A base that moves between the rebase and the ref swap is a race between two
runs landing at once; ``SWAP_ATTEMPTS`` says how many times to rebase onto the
new base and try again before it stops being self-correcting and becomes the
human's problem.

Verification currently enforces declared checks followed by mechanical
tripwires. The retained agent-review seam is unwired and non-blocking. The merge
itself happens in a THROWAWAY WORKTREE: the base branch ref is updated with
``git update-ref``, so the owner's checkout, which routinely holds
uncommitted work, is never touched.

Self-contained by design: the git helpers live here, not in worktree.py.

Per-project configuration, in ``.orchestra/config.toml``::

    [merge]
    base = "main"            # default: the branch the project root has checked out
    max_files = 50           # tripwire: files touched by the diff
    max_lines = 2000         # tripwire: insertions + deletions
    allow_deletions = false  # tripwire: any deleted file
    project_paths = ["src"]  # tripwire: a touched file outside these prefixes
    check_timeout = 1800     # per-check seconds
    require_clean = false    # opt-in: refuse the merge when the owner's
                             # uncommitted edits OVERLAP the merged files.
                             # Off by default — the merge lands either way and
                             # the checkout simply keeps its pre-merge tree.
    judge_tripwires = true   # a model judges tripwired facts against the mission first
    resolver_profile = "big" # resolver staffing; unset = best tier-2 profile
                             # dispatch (default: the highest-priority tier-3 profile)

    [merge.checks]           # declared checks, run in declared order
    test = "uv run python -m unittest discover -s tests"
    lint = "ruff check ."

Result shape (a plain dict, ready for the caller to post to Work)::

    {"ok", "stage", "escalation", "base", "branch", "commit", "files_changed",
     "checks", "checks_skipped", "tripwires", "review", "conflicts",
     "revert_command", "branch_deleted", "refresh", "note", "kept_ref",
     "dropped", "dirty"}

``stage`` is where the run stopped: dirty | rebase | checks | tripwires |
review | merged. ``commit`` is the merge commit this run created, and is None
when the base already contained the branch — then there is no merge commit and
no ``revert_command``, because a revert line aimed at a commit the run did not
create either errors or undoes somebody else's work (I-0077). ``refresh`` reports what happened to a checkout sitting on the base
branch (refreshed | skipped | refused, always with a reason). ``merge_run``
never posts to Work and never resolves a conflict.

``at_completion`` is the other half (W-0174): the seam ``supervise.py`` calls
when a run reaches ``done``, which lands the branch and then *reports* —
Work thread, item transition, Nod card. Nothing in it may break finalization.
